DoKa Seca draws inspiration from numerous cloud-native platform engineering projects and initiatives.
This page acknowledges the innovative work that has influenced the design and implementation of our platform bootstrapping framework.

## Platform Engineering Inspirations

DoKa Seca is inspired by the following projects and platforms that have shaped modern cloud-native platform engineering:

### Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

- **[Janus IDP](https://janus-idp.io/)** - Red Hat's open-source Internal Developer Platform built on Backstage, providing enterprise-ready developer portal capabilities
- **[choreo-idp](https://github.com/choreo-idp/choreo)** - Cloud-native platform for building and deploying applications with strong GitOps integration
- **[Mia-Platform](https://docs.mia-platform.eu/)** - Comprehensive platform for fast software delivery with microservices architecture
- **[Devtron](https://docs.devtron.ai/)** - Open-source software delivery workflow for Kubernetes with CI/CD and GitOps

### Cloud-Native Operating Systems

- **[Deckhouse](https://github.com/deckhouse/deckhouse)** - Kubernetes platform that provides a seamless experience for deploying and managing containerized applications
