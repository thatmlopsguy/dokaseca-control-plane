## About the Tech Radar

The tech radar is a visual tool that categorizes technologies into four rings:

- **ADOPT**: Technologies we have high confidence in and recommend for widespread use
- **TRIAL**: Technologies worth pursuing with known success cases but some risk
- **ASSESS**: Promising technologies worth exploring with higher risks
- **HOLD**: Technologies to proceed with caution or avoid for new projects

Technologies are also organized into four quadrants:

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Programming languages and development frameworks
- **Tools**: Development and operational tools
- **Platforms**: Infrastructure and platform technologies
- **Techniques**: Methods, processes, and architectural patterns

The radar visualization is based on the [Zalando Tech Radar](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar) implementation.
