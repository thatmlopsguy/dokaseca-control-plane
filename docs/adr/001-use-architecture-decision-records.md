# Use Architecture Decision Records

Date: 2025-07-07

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The DoKa Seca project is a comprehensive framework for bootstrapping cloud-native platforms, involving numerous architectural decisions around infrastructure choices, tooling selections, deployment patterns, and platform configurations. As the project evolves and the team grows, we're seeing several issues:

1. **Loss of knowledge**: Understanding why certain architectural choices were made becomes unclear over time
2. **Repeated discussions**: The same decisions get debated multiple times without remembering previous conclusions
3. **Onboarding difficulty**: New team members and contributors struggle to understand the reasoning behind current architecture
4. **Inconsistent decisions**: Without documented principles, new decisions may conflict with established patterns
5. **Review challenges**: Architectural changes lack structured evaluation criteria

Without a systematic approach to documenting architectural decisions, the project risks loss of institutional knowledge, repeated discussions about previously settled matters, inconsistent architectural approaches, difficulty onboarding new contributors, and unclear rationale for existing design choices.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document all significant architectural decisions in the DoKa Seca project.

**What qualifies as an architectural decision:**

- Choice of technologies, frameworks, or tools
- Infrastructure patterns and deployment strategies
- Security policies and implementation approaches
- GitOps workflow and repository structure decisions
- Platform configuration standards and conventions
- Integration patterns between components
- Breaking changes to existing interfaces or workflows

**ADR Process:**

1. Create ADRs for all new significant architectural decisions
2. Use the standard ADR format (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences)
3. Store ADRs in the `/docs/adr/` directory
4. Number ADRs sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
5. Include ADRs in pull request reviews for architectural changes
6. Update the ADR index when adding new records

## Consequences

**What becomes easier:**

- New contributors can understand the reasoning behind current architecture through documented context
- Team members avoid revisiting previously decided matters, reducing decision fatigue
- Architectural decisions maintain consistency through explicit documentation of principles and patterns
- Code reviews include structured evaluation of architectural impacts
- Historical evolution of the platform architecture is preserved and traceable

**What becomes more difficult:**

- Writing ADRs requires additional time and effort from the team during development
- Team members must remember to create ADRs for qualifying decisions, adding process overhead
- ADR index and cross-references need ongoing maintenance to stay current
- Risk of over-documenting minor decisions if scope isn't well-defined, potentially creating bureaucracy
