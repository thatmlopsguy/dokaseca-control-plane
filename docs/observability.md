# Observability

Continuous Monitoring & Observability increases agility, improves customer experience and reduces risk of the cloud
environment. According to Wikipedia, Observability is a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred
from the knowledge of its external outputs. The term observability itself originates from the field of control theory,
where it basically means that you can infer the internal state of the components in a system by learning about the
external signals/outputs it is producing.

The difference between Monitoring and Observability is that Monitoring tells you whether a system is working or not,
while Observability tells you why the system isnâ€™t working. Monitoring is usually a reactive measure whereas the goal of
Observability is to be able to improve your Key Performance Indicators in a proactive manner. A system cannot be
controlled or optimized unless it is observed. Instrumenting workloads through collection of metrics, logs, or traces
and gaining meaningful insights & detailed context using the right monitoring and observability tools help customers
control and optimize the environment.
