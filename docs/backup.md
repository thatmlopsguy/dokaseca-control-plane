# Backup

Velero gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. You can run
Velero with a public cloud platform or on-premises.

Velero lets you:

- Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
- Migrate cluster resources to other clusters.
- Replicate your production cluster to development and testing clusters.
